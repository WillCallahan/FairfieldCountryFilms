                                        <h3>PAYMENT</h3>
                                        <p>An initial deposit is required with all contracts. The deposit fee should not
                                            exceed 25% of the
                                            total estimated cost of the contract. Please note that the deposit is not
                                            refundable unless the
                                            videographer is unable to attend the event or otherwise noted in the
                                            contract.
                                            <br><br>
                                            The remaining cost of the contract should be paid as described above. The
                                            final product will
                                            not be given to the client until all funds are received.</p>

                                        <h3>DELIVERY OF FINISHED PRODUCT</h3>
                                        <p>Clients are welcome to pick up their video(s) in person or at a location no
                                            more than 15 miles
                                            from the city of Danbury. In addition, the video(s) may be received through
                                            mailing at
                                            the expense of the client.</p>

                                        <h3>USAGE</h3>
                                        <p>Both the raw and final edited footage filmed by Fairfield County Films
                                            remains to be solely owned
                                            by the client. The client has the right to use the video for any purpose
                                            they so wish. However,
                                            the client is responsible for following copyright laws of the media.
                                            Fairfield County Films will
                                            not be responsible for copyright infringement based on the use of the video
                                            by the client.
                                            Note that Fairfield County Films reserves the right to use any clients'
                                            video for promotion
                                            purposes unless the client explicitly requests that Fairfield County Films
                                            does not do so.</p>

                                        <h3>POSTPONEMENT/CANCELLATION</h3>
                                        <p>In the event that the client cancels the event or does not wish to use
                                            Fairfield County Films'
                                            services, the initial deposit is not refundable. If the event is postponed,
                                            the client must
                                            conform to the available dates of Fairfield County Films. In addition,
                                            Fairfield County Films reserves
                                            the right to assign a different videographer that originally planned. If
                                            Fairfield County Films
                                            cannot provide a substitute for a postponement, Fairfield County Films may
                                            withdraw from the event.
                                            In such a case, all payments but the deposit will be refunded.</p>

                                        <h3>LIABILITY</h3>
                                        <p>Fairfield County Films takes the utmost care with respect to the production,
                                            postproduction and
                                            delivery of the video(s). However, if Fairfield County Films fails to comply
                                            with the terms of
                                            this contract, due to any event or act outside the control of Fairfield
                                            County Films, Fairfield County Film's
                                            liability is limited entirely to the deposits paid. Fairfield County Films
                                            shall not be
                                            held liable for injury or damages exceeding the value of this agreement and
                                            limits any
                                            liability for loss, damage, or failure to deliver the videos, for any reason
                                            to the return of
                                            all payments previously made. The client agrees that no further legal action
                                            will be pursued.</p>

                                        <h3>ASSIGNS/SUBSTITUTIONS</h3>
                                        <p>In the event of illness or injury, Fairfield County Films reserves the right
                                            to assign a new
                                            videographer for the event, other than who had already been assigned. The
                                            client will be
                                            provided with proper identification information about the substitute. Note
                                            that the
                                            substitution of a videographer will not lower the quality of the video. All
                                            videographers
                                            contracted with Fairfield County Films and trained to uphold the highest
                                            standard of
                                            professionalism in our field.</p>

                                        <h3>PRODUCTION</h3>
                                        <p>In the unlikely case that a particular segment of the event is either not
                                            recorded, partially
                                            recorded, or recorded un-acceptably due to an equipment error, equipment
                                            failure, or
                                            videographer error, Fairfield County Films will not charge the client for
                                            that time and will agree
                                            to a re-shoot of that segment at no charge to the client. Please note that
                                            this case may not be
                                            applied where specific conditions of an event cause failure to produce the
                                            desired product.
                                            This includes, but is not limited to, low light conditions, causing a grainy
                                            video, or
                                            inclement weather conditions outdoors, where we may not operate our
                                            equipment.</p>

                                        <h3>COLLABORATION</h3>
                                        <p>Fairfield County Films aspires to meet all of the expectations of the client.
                                            In order to do so,
                                            Fairfield County Films will work closely to the client in order to receive a
                                            final product in which
                                            the client desires in conjunction with what the package of the video
                                            entails. Please note that
                                            any misunderstandings between Fairfield County Films and the client will not
                                            be charged to the
                                            client. However, if the client, for example, changes their mind on how they
                                            would like the
                                            final product to look, Fairfield County Films reserves the right to charge
                                            the client for any extra
                                            editing time and materials required to complete the video.

                                            It is the sole responsibility for the client to provide all extra materials
                                            to Fairfield County
                                            Films in a timely fashion in order to receive the final product on time.
                                            This includes any
                                            pictures or music that the video should contain which without the
                                            participation of the client,
                                            the video would not otherwise have. Any video which requires materials from
                                            the client will not
                                            be given to the client until Fairfield County Films receives all materials
                                            as outlined in the
                                            contract.</p>


                                        <h3>COMPATIBILITY</h3>
                                        <p>Fairfield County Films currently uses the most up to date professional disc
                                            authoring software from
                                            Sony. The disc authoring format used by Fairfield County Films is a standard
                                            across all modern set
                                            top boxes. In the unlikely event that a client is unable to play a DVD or
                                            Blu-Ray, Fairfield County
                                            Films is not responsible for a client's inability to play a video based on
                                            incompatibility
                                            issues. It is the sole responsibility for the client to obtain the most up
                                            to date hardware to
                                            view today's standards of media. In such a case, Fairfield County Films will
                                            offer a digital media
                                            copy for playback on a computer at no extra chard to the client. Please note
                                            that the digital
                                            media copy does not include the physical media in which the video is
                                            transferred. Rather, the
                                            digital media copy only includes the video itself. If the client wishes to
                                            receive a media
                                            device in which to store and transfer the video to and from, such as a hard
                                            drive, the client
                                            will be charged the appropriate fee for the media device.<br/><br/>

                                            Fairfield County Films renders videos in the most widely supported formats
                                            such as AVCHD and MP4. Such
                                            video formats are generally supported on all operating systems. However, in
                                            the event that the client
                                            cannot play a digital media copy, Fairfield County Films will offer to
                                            render the product in a different format once,
                                            such as MPEG-1, MPEG-2, WMV, AVI, AC-3, AVC, MOV, MXF, ect. It is the sole
                                            responsibility for the client to check
                                            system compatibility before requesting a different format. Any additional
                                            re-renders will be charged to the client
                                            for a nominal fee.</p>
